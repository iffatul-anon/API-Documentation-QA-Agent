        "message": "### Authenticating API Requests\nTo authenticate API requests, you can use the following methods:\n\n* **API Keys**: The Stripe API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Stripe Dashboard.\n* **Test Mode Secret Keys**: Test mode secret keys have the prefix `sk_test_` and live mode secret keys have the prefix `sk_live_`.\n* **Restricted API Keys**: You can use restricted API keys for granular permissions.\n\n### Steps to Authenticate API Requests\n1. **Obtain an API Key**: Get your API key from the Stripe Dashboard.\n2. **Choose the Correct API Key**: Select the correct API key based on whether you are in test mode or live mode.\n3. **Make Requests over HTTPS**: All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail.\n4. **Include the API Key in the Request**: You can include the API key in the request using the `-u` flag with `curl`, for example: \n```bash\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\\n  -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\n```\n5. **Use the Stripe-Account Header for Connected Accounts**: To act as connected accounts, clients can issue requests using the `Stripe-Account` special header. Make sure that this header contains a Stripe account ID, which usually starts with the `acct_` prefix.\n\n### Example Request\n```bash\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\\n  -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n  -H \"Stripe-Account: acct_1032D82eZvKYlo2C\" \\\n  -G\n```"

        "message": "### Parameters for Create Charge Endpoint\nThe create charge endpoint requires the following parameters:\n\n* **amount**: The amount to charge. This is a required parameter.\n* **currency**: The currency to charge in. This is a required parameter.\n* **source**: The source of the charge. This can be a card, bank account, or other payment method.\n* **description**: A description of the charge. This is an optional parameter.\n\n### Optional Parameters\nThe following parameters are optional:\n\n* **capture**: Whether to capture the charge immediately. Default is `true`.\n* **statement_descriptor**: A descriptor for the statement. This is an optional parameter.\n* **receipt_email**: The email address to send the receipt to. This is an optional parameter.\n* **metadata**: A set of key-value pairs to store with the charge. This is an optional parameter.\n\n### Example Request\n```bash\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\\n  -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n  -X POST \\\n  -d \"amount=1000\" \\\n  -d \"currency=usd\" \\\n  -d \"source=tok_visa\" \\\n  -d \"description=Test Charge\"\n```\nNote: You should replace the `sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2` with your actual API key.\n\n### API Response\nThe API will respond with a JSON object containing the charge details, including the charge ID, amount, currency, and status.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the [Stripe API documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/charges/create)."

        "message": "### Rate Limiting in Stripe API\nThe Stripe API applies rate limiting **per account**, not per user. This means that the rate limits are shared across all users and requests made on behalf of a particular Stripe account.\n\n### Understanding Rate Limits\nStripe uses a leaky bucket algorithm to manage rate limits. This algorithm allows for bursts of requests while preventing sustained high volumes of traffic.\n\n### Best Practices to Avoid Rate Limiting\nTo avoid hitting rate limits, you can:\n* **Batch similar requests**: Group similar requests together to reduce the number of API calls.\n* **Use caching**: Cache frequently accessed data to reduce the number of requests made to the Stripe API.\n* **Implement exponential backoff**: If you receive a rate limit error, implement exponential backoff to retry the request after a certain amount of time.\n\n### API Error Codes for Rate Limiting\nIf you exceed the rate limits, you will receive an error response with a `429` status code, indicating \"Too Many Requests\".\n\nFor more information on rate limiting, please refer to the [Stripe API documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api)."
